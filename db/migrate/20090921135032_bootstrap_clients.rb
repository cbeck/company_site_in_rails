      :story => "<p>In Febraury of 2008, Netphase, in partnership with Name Dynamics, launched UniversalBusinessListing.org (UBL) to provide a new value proposition in the area of Search Engine Optimization. The problem we were trying to address is simple: with so many avenues for your website and business information to be listed on the Internet, how do you insure consistency of information, and more importantly, how do you maintain all of that information should anything change?</p><p>There needed to be a one-stop-shop, so to speak, where you could submit your business information and trust that it would get to all of the relevant search engines and information repositories expeditiously. Well, UniversalBusinessListing.org is such a place. And thanks to our partnership with InfoUSA, we can provide a level of service and consistency of information dissemination previously unavailable on the Internet.</p><p>The list and breadth of directories we submit your information to is impressive. Our submission directories include:</p><ul><li>Search Engines such as Google, Yahoo, MSN</li><li>Online Yellow Pages such as Superpages, Yellowpages.com</li><li>Portals and Guides such as AOL, CitySearch</li><li>Cell Phones and Mobile devices such as BlackBerry and iPhone</li><li>411 Directory Assistance</li><li>In-Car GPS Navigation</li><li>Telematics such as OnStar</li></ul><p>Perhaps the best feature of UBL, however, may be its price. Similar services that submit your listings to only a fraction of the places we submit to, or submit your information to a large collection of fringe sites that have no real impact on your search engine results, charge hundreds of dollars per year. Some even tip the scales over $1,000 or more. The cost for a complete Universal Business Listing for your site? Just $30 per year. That’s right. $30, with no strings attached.</p><p>You don’t even need to pay while you are registering your sites. You can create a FREE account, and register as many sites as you wish. Once you are ready to submit one of your registered sites to our collection of directories, you simply click a button in your business listing page and then pay for that site at that time. This allows you to control your costs and also to make sure that your site is ready and optimized for searches before submission. At only $30, your business can’t afford NOT to have a Universal Business Listing.</p><p>In addition to taking care of individual business owners, we cater to large organizations and affiliates as well. We offer bulk upload facilities, so even if you have thousands of locations or many individual businesses, we can provide a convenient way for you to list all of your sites and business information. We offer special volume price breaks and the ability to earn affiliate revenue as well. Contact us today to find out how you can save money for your business, or perhaps even make money promoting UBL to your customers!</p><h3>About Netphase’s Role with UBL</h3><p>Netphase developed UBL using the Ruby on Rails application development framework in a matter of a few short months and launched UBL in February 2008. UBL is deployed on an infinitely scalable, stable and robust architecture designed and maintained by Netphase within the Amazon Enhanced Computing Cloud, or EC2, infrastructure. Since the launch, Netphase has provided many enhancements to the UBL site, and we currently maintain the application in its entirety.</p><p>In the future, Netphase will offer new products and services related to UBL directly to UBL customers and affiliates. These offerings are currently in development, and will provide significant additional value to a service that some believe is already the best search value offering available in the world.</p><p>If you are interested in having Netphase turn your application dream into a reality, <a href='/contact_us'>contact us today</a>. We offer free initial consultations, and are always interested in hearing about exciting new mobile and web applications.</p>",

      :story => "<p>Netphase launched its first in what is expected to be a long line of web applications based on its new virtual mall engine, WeSell.  WeSell aims to conquer some of the problems typically associated with selling from multiple vendors in a shopping cart-based system, utilizing only one checkout.</p><p>The technology behind it is really quite remarkable. Netphase’s proprietary solution takes into account the available inventory of the seller, who typically will be an average user with products in their possession that they wish to resell. It prevents shopping cart conflicts, yet also considers how long a prospective buyer is allowed to keep an item in his cart before the item is returned back to the active inventory for others to purchase. Bottom line is that it strives to strike the difficult balance of allowing a seller to have inventory tied up by only those wanting to purchase, and also of allowing a buyer with an item in her cart to shop with confidence, knowing that when she checks out, the item is in fact hers.</p><p>Other features of WeSell protect both the buyer and seller by way of a built-in transaction escrow system. It is fully secure, deployed in the infinitely scalable Amazon EC2 Cloud, and of course, it runs on Ruby on Rails.</p><h3>About Homeschool Apple</h3><p>The Homeschool Apple mission is to be an oasis for homeschoolers on the internet.
